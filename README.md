### Architecture

YATB requires a market data provider (e.g. Binance) and can register N advisors upon initialization. An advisor is basically an array of sights, each sight having a symbol (e.g. `BTCUSDT`), timeframe (e.g. `5m`) and optionally strategies to follow. The bot will start receiving market data for each of the sights and will calculate indicators accordingly as required by strategies. Advisors will in turn be notified by the bot when market data has changed (i.e. a new candle has finished drawing) and execute strategies on data. If any strategy triggers a signal, the advisor will broadcast a message together with `trade` params for the strategy and the bot will pick it up, place an order, and manage the trade until it's closed. All this internal communication happens asynchronously using RxJS.

### Creating strategies

You can create your own strategies and use them within your advisor(s) (Node.js skills required), browse existing [strategies](https://github.com/lropero/yatb/tree/master/strategies) to see how they are built (TODO: write how-to-build-strategy documentation). You can use any of [these indicators](https://tulipindicators.org/list), refer to `Function Prototype` on each indicator from that list to build the `params` object required by strategies (or see how existing strategies match up things ðŸ˜…).

Please consider naming and sharing your strategy by creating a pull request.
